## Getting started

This solution is built on top of [Azure IoT Edge](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge), and to be able to work locally and run it locally, you will need the development
environment - read more about that [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/development-environment).
It mentions the use of the [iotedgedev](https://github.com/Azure/iotedgedev) tool.

### VSCode

If you are using VSCode or similar text editor, just open up the folder from the root. This solution uses a [sub-module](https://github.com/dolittle-tools/DotNET.Build) (as described above).
It comes with a few things that makes development a little bit easier, a set of VSCode tasks as described [here](https://github.com/dolittle-tools/DotNET.Build#visual-studio-code-tasks).

In addition to this there is a couple of Debug launch settings set up as well to enable debugging directly.

### Visual Studio 201x

Open up the [.sln](./KChief.sln) file at the root of the project.

## Deploying

### Module

In your `deployment.json` file, you will need to add the module. For more details on modules in IoT Edge, go [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/module-composition).
